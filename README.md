## La palabra del dia entre amigos. Competencia. (Wordl with friends)

if you want to play wordl with your friends, you can do it with Telegram.
Every day we play and try to figure out which is the word of the day in Wordl. Then in our private group we publish the results. (Fair Play and Good faith is a comintment in the group. )
Once a year we publish the results and the winner of the competition.
